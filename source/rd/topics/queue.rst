queue
===============

:func:`queue`

Create a ``queue`` object which containg details about how a job is submitted.

Usage
""""""""""""""""""
::

 queue(object, submit_exe, queue = "long", nodes = 1, cpu = 1, dependency = list(), jobname = "name", walltime, cwd = "~/flows", memory, stderr = "~/flows/tmp", stdout = "~/flows", email = Sys.getenv("USER"), type = c("lsf", "torque", "sge"), format = "", extra_opts = "", verbose = TRUE, server = "localhost", ...)

Arguments

object
    this is not used currenlty, ignore.
submit_exe
    the exact command used to submit jobs to the cluster example ``qsub`` ``bsub`` etc.
queue
    the type of queue your group usually uses
nodes
    number of nodes you would like to request. *optional* [Used by class job]
cpu
    number of cpus you would like to reserve [Used by class job]
dependency
    a list of jobs to complete before starting this one [Used by class job]
jobname
    name of this job in the computing cluster [Used by class job]
walltime
    max walltime of a job. [Used by class job]
cwd
    [Used by class job]
memory
    The amount of memory reserved. Units depend on the platform used to process jobs
stderr
    [Used by class job]
stdout
    [Used by class job]
email
    [Used by class job]
type
    Required and important. Currently supported values are 'lsf' and 'torque'. [Used by class job]
format
    We have a default format for the final command line string generated for 'lsf' and 'torque'.
This defined the exact (``bsub``/``qsub``) used to submit the job. One of the most important features required is:
dependencies. More on them here:
extra_opts
    [Used by class job]
verbose
    [logical] TRUE/FALSE
server
    This is not implemented currently. This would specify the head node of the computing cluster. At this time submission needs to be done on the head node of the cluster where flow is to be submitted
...
    other passed onto object creation. Example: memory, walltime, cpu


Description
""""""""""""""""""

This function defines the queue used to submit jobs to the cluster. In essence details about the
computing cluster in use.


Examples
""""""""""""""""""
::

 qobj <- queue(type='lsf')
 Setting default time to:  72:00 . If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail. You may change this in job()
 Setting default memory to:  10000 . If this is more than queue max (/improper format), job will fail.
