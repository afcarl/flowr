Here are a few basic issues you may find while working with flowr; and their fixes.

## checking flow definition

**Missing resource columns**
Its possible subsequent steps fail due to missing columns. 
Even if you are explicity describing resoruces in cluster templates.
Add dummy values here, to prevent issues.

**fetch flow details**
To get details on a submitted flow, one must provide a flow object as ", 
"returned by submit_flow() function. ",
"This has details on job submission IDs etc. ", 
"Alternatively, you may supply the execution path for this flow (flow_wd). ",
"The status of the flow you provided (x@status): ", x@status))
