{"name":"Flow","tagline":"R package to submit jobs to a queue system using object oriented programming","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sahilseth/flow.png)](https://travis-ci.org/sahilseth/flow)\r\n\r\nflow\r\n======\r\n\r\nR pacakge to design (and submit) complex workflows, such that optimization/parallelization is easy.\r\n\r\nHere is a shiny app, [flow_creator](https://sseth.shinyapps.io/flow_creator/) for you start building your `shiny` flow.\r\n[`guest; guestpass`]\r\n\r\nThe process of submitting jobs uses the `dependency` feature of submitting jobs to a computing cluster.\r\nThis lets the user concentrate more on the type of analysis than its implmentation. Also the pipeline becomes really portable across platforms and institutions.\r\n\r\nJust get me started...\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages('devtools')\r\ndevtools:::install_github(\"sahilseth/flow\")\r\nrequire(flow)\r\nqobj <- queue(type=\"lsf\", queue=\"normal\")\r\njobj1 <- job()\r\njobj2 <- job()\r\nfobj <- flow(jobs = list(jobj1, jobj2)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of now we have tested this on the following clusters:\r\n\r\n|Platform|submission commnd|Works?|queue type *|\r\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\r\n|LSF HPC 7|bsub|Not tested|lsf\r\n|LSF 9.1|bsub|Yes|lsf\r\n|Torque|qsub|Yes|torque\r\n|SGE|qsub|Not implemented|\r\n\r\n*queue short-name used in [flow](https://github.com/sahilseth/flow)\r\n\r\nThere are several [job scheduling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler) systems available and we try to support the major players. Adding support is quite easy if we have access to them (otherwise not). Your favoroite not in the list?
