Running examples flows
This wraps a few steps:
Get all the commands to run (flow_mat)
Create a `flow` object, using flow_mat and a default flowdef (picked from the same folder).
Use `submit_flow()` to submit this to the cluster.}

\item{x}{name of the pipeline to run. This is a function called to create a flow_mat.}
